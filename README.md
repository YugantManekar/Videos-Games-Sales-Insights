The project aimed to create an interactive Sales Dashboard for analyzing key metrics like revenue, trends, regional performance, and top products, enabling data-driven sales optimization. It involved data collection from multiple sources, cleaning with Power Query, and structuring using a star schema. Relationships were established for efficient analysis. Power BI visualizations like charts, maps, and slicers were used, with filters and drill-throughs for better insights. The dashboard offers interactive reports with filters. It provides performance insights on top regions, products, and customer behavior.
